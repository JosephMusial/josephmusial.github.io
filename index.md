# About me

# Home Labs

In order to give myself real-world, hands-on experience with cybersecurity I've begin using the tools used by security professionals today in my own life. Whether it's using Wireshark on my home Wi-Fi - which showed me my Smart TV was constantly sending out pings, even after I turned it off - or setting up a Microsoft Azure VM and analyzing attempted intrusions, I've gained valuable experience in the tools of the trade.

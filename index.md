# Home Labs

In order to give myself real-world, hands-on experience with cybersecurity I've begin using the tools used by security professionals today in my own life. Whether it's using Wireshark on my home Wi-Fi - which showed me my Smart TV was constantly sending out pings, even after I turned it off - or setting up a Microsoft Azure VM and analyzing attempted intrusions, I've gained valuable experience in the tools of the trade.

## Azure Lab

In this lab, I set up a virtual machine running Microsoft Server, deliberately leaving the RDP port open on 3389 and logged the resulting login attempts. I set up different alerts in Sentinel, automatically creating incidents for events such as unsuccessful logins, successful logins, and other events.

# About me

Welcome to my portfolio. I hold a Masters degree in cybersecurity, I am a professional software developer of nearly five years, and, also of note, I am an Eagle Scout. I was first exposed to the world of InfoSec during a college internship where, after my first time in the SOC, I found my career calling. Since that time, I've completed my both Bachelors and Masters degrees, earning academic honors in my Masters. I've attended conferences, made home labs, and am currently pursuing both my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity, and Security+ certifications. 

I can bring a unique set of skills to your organization thanks to my uncommon pathway to cybersecurity. While most entry level cybersecurity analysts work their way up through helpdesk or networking, I am coming into this field as a software developer. This affords me the opportunity of a perspective not often shared by others coming into the field. My work experience allows me to understand the software developer's perspective in access management. Finally, thanks to my work experience, I am able to more intuitively understand malicious code than others.

# Home Labs

In order to give myself real-world, hands-on experience with cybersecurity I've begin using the tools used by security professionals today in my own life. Whether it's using Wireshark on my home Wi-Fi - which showed me my Smart TV was constantly sending out pings, even after I turned it off - or setting up a Microsoft Azure VM and analyzing attempted intrusions, I've gained valuable experience in the tools of the trade.

## Azure Lab

In this lab, I set up a virtual machine running Microsoft Server, deliberately leaving the RDP port open on 3389 and logged the resulting login attempts. I set up different alerts in Sentinel, automatically creating incidents for events such as unsuccessful logins, successful logins, and other events.
